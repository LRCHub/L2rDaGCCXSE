Always new days
Flying up ahead
I'll find you there

Nighttime rolls by
Sleeping in my bed
Painting clouds in my head
For days ahead

Daytime is all mine
Pacing up and down
I didn't even think to frown
With days ahead

Always new days
Flying up ahead
I'll find you there

Just in the middle
Where hands and lips are weak
It's all but a riddle to me
The days ahead

To think I'm just but a little
Not a star to shine at night
Haven't got enough fuel to ignite
The days ahead

Always (la la la la la)
New days (la la la la la)
Flying up ahead
I'll find you there
