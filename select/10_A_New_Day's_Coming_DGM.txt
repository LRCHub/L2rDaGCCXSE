I'm missing you now and I feel so afraid
But I'm living today for the last time again
For everything was gone for everytime I'll think of you
I've the solution to leave my faith in you

I need an answer to believe in what you said
I need my answer to believe

There is no doubt into my heart the fears are falling
There's no reaction to your eyes
A new day's coming
Sometimes I'm really satisfied
Sometimes I wonder why
We cannot see the light again,
The light again

Waiting for another night,
Waiting for
Now that I'm feeling it inside
Now that you're mine before the light
Shine on you like a star

I need an answer to believe in what you said
I need an answer to believe

There is no doubt into my heart the fears are falling
There's no reaction to your eyes
A new day's coming
Sometimes I'm really satisfied
Sometimes I wonder why
We cannot see the light again,
The light again
